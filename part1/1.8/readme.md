# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Exercise Objective : 
Refactor your application so that displaying the statistics is extracted into its own Statistics component. The state of the application should remain in the App root component.

Remember that components should not be defined inside other components:
```jsx
// a proper place to define a component
const Statistics = (props) => {
  // ...
}

const App = () => {
  const [good, setGood] = useState(0)
  const [neutral, setNeutral] = useState(0)
  const [bad, setBad] = useState(0)

  // do not define a component within another component
  const Statistics = (props) => {
    // ...
  }

  return (
    // ...
  )
}

```
