# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Exercise Objective : 

Let's take the changes one step further. Change the course and its parts into a single JavaScript object. Fix everything that breaks.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    name: 'Half Stack application development',
    parts: [
      {
        name: 'Fundamentals of React',
        exercises: 10
      },
      {
        name: 'Using props to pass data',
        exercises: 7
      },
      {
        name: 'State of a component',
        exercises: 14
      }
    ]
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Exercise Proceed : 
Exercise completed within 10 minutes of practice. With the help of console.log() I orientated myself on the statement path of data listenning with the new object created and simply changed the hierarchy accessibility of those components : <Header course={course.name} />
      <Content partsList={course.parts} />
      <Total partsList={course.parts} />
