# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Exercise Objective 

Like most companies, the student restaurant of the University of Helsinki Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. Your task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.

The application must display the total number of collected feedback for each category. Your final application could look like this:

```jsx
//main.jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

import App from './App'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)
```

```jsx
//app.jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

const App = () => {
  // save clicks of each button to its own state
  const [good, setGood] = useState(0)
  const [neutral, setNeutral] = useState(0)
  const [bad, setBad] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      code here
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
