Remember to keep your console open at all times. If you see this warning in your console:

Then perform the necessary actions to make the warning disappear. Try pasting the error message into a search engine if you get stuck.

Typical source of an error Unchecked runtime.lastError: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist. is Chrome extension. Try going to chrome://extensions/ and try disabling them one by one and refreshing React app page; the error should eventually disappear.

Make sure that from now on you don't see any warnings in your console!
